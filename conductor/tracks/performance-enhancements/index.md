# Performance Enhancements

- **Track ID:** `performance-enhancements`
- **Plan:** [plan.md](./plan.md)

## Context
This track focuses on improving the performance, responsiveness, and startup speed of the ShinKu application. The optimizations cover Jetpack Compose, database queries, startup initialization, and dependency modernization.

## Key Decisions
- **Verification First:** Every phase requires rigorous testing (unit, integration, or manual) to ensure optimizations do not introduce regressions.
- **Iterative Approach:** Changes will be made incrementally, focusing on one area at a time.
