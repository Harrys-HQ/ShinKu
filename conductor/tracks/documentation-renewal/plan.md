# Plan: Documentation Renewal

## Phase 1: Research & Audit
- [x] Audit codebase for "retained" vs "removed" features.
- [x] Verify status of "Latest Tab" (replaced by Feed).
- [x] Verify status of "Sync" (replaced by Dropbox).
- [x] Verify presence of 8 unique ShinKu features.

## Phase 2: Implementation
- [x] Update `docs/index.md` with comprehensive feature lists and setup guide.
- [x] Update `README.md` to match `docs/index.md` and clarify "Retained Core Features".
- [x] Update `conductor/product.md` to be the project's source of truth.
- [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` to accurately list 2.0.0 features.
- [x] Update `docs/version.json` with correct URLs.

## Phase 3: Validation
- [x] Verify links and formatting in all modified files.
- [x] Ensure consistency across all documentation platforms.
