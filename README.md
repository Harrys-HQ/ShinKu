## ✨ Unique ShinKu Features

In addition to all features from TachiyomiSY and Mihon, ShinKu introduces:

*   **Vibe Search (AI Discovery):** Search for manga using natural language descriptions (e.g., "dark psychological thriller with a female protagonist") powered by Google Gemini AI.
*   **Reading Journey Card:** A beautiful, interactive statistics card at the top of your "More" tab tracking your total chapters read and time spent reading.
*   **Dynamic Theme Overhaul:** An immersive UI where the application colors shift dynamically to match the palette of the manga cover you are currently viewing.
*   **Smart Categorizer:** Automatically organize your library into clean, one-word categories: *Library, Reading, Queue, Finished, and Dropped* based on your reading progress and series status.
*   **Dead Source Scanner:** Specialized tool to find and quickly migrate manga from uninstalled extensions.
*   **Failed Updates Migration:** A dedicated menu to easily handle and migrate manga that failed to refresh in your last library update.
*   **Library Update Speed Toggle:** Control your update concurrency with three specialized modes: Standard, Boost, and Extreme.
*   **Metadata Refresh Cooldown:** Enforced 7-day cooldown on automatic metadata refreshes to save network data and prioritize speed.
